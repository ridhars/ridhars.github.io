title: Maximizing WomenTechWomenYes Awareness & Sustainability - Metis's Project 1
---

Beginning in Week 1, we are immediately tasked to help WomenTech WomenYes, an organization set out to promote women presence within the tech industries. They have teams ready to be placed on the streets surrounding New York's subway stations. The objective is to gain as much awareness and ultimately raise donation for their upcoming gala. However, the question remains, of all subway stations in New York, which one to attend?

### Approach
To maximize effectiveness, we defined an objective: getting the *right people* as *many* as possible. We need an audience interested in the topic & willing to contribute, as many we can find.  

In order to achieve this objective, these data were being used:
* MTA Daily Traffic Data -- primary data
* Income Data (taken from US Census Data)
* Google API (additional data to complement Income Data)
